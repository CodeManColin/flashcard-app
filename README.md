Flashcard App "The Flash-O-Matic!"

Tools used: 

-React

-JavaScript

-HTML

-CSS

-Bootstrap

-GIT

This project was designed to test the ability to work with rendering and state management using React. 
More specifcally it involved:

-Installing packages via NPM

-Running tests from the command line

-Writing React function components

-Creating routes, including nested routes, using React Router

-Using hooks like useState(), useParams(), and useHistory()

-Debugging React code through console output and using the VS Code debugger

Completing this application was a great experience better understanding Front-end routing, expecially with nested routes, and "lifting up" state to parent components.
